Dynamo - dynamic avatar MOD for phpBB
============================

This MOD provides the ability to edit your avatar, using bodily features and clothes that can be purchased or acquired. In the vein of 2.0x MODs like Live Avatar and Nulavatar, and the dynamic avatar capabilities of the 3.0x MOD Camorea Suite. Useful for RPG forums.

**Why is it called _Dynamo_?**

Because I couldn't think of a better name and I needed a short name for database tables and config field names.

**Notes to self**

*	Delete file if the item is deleted? Or if the image file is changed
*	Make the dynamo filepath (for uploaded images) ACP-configurable (dir must be chmodded to 777)
*   Remote avatar must be enabled ...
*   Which dirs to chmod?
